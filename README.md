# Mastermind_Project
Mastermind Game made as a final project for Introduction to Computer Science course.

Game rules:
You're trying to guess a pattern of four code pegs, choosed by the computer.
You need to guess colours and order of the pegs.
On the left side, there are four small pegs, which are passing information about your progress.
The black peg informs you that the larger peg on the same spot on the board is in the right place.
The blue peg tells you that the larger peg in that colour is in diffrent place on the board.
You've got 10 turns to get your code right.
Good luck, Loser!
