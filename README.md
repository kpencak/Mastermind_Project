# Mastermind_Project
Mastermind Game made as a final project for Introduction to Computer Science course.<br/>

Game rules:<br/>
<p>You're trying to guess a pattern of four code pegs, choosed by the computer.<br/>
You need to guess colours and order of the pegs.<br/>
On the left side, there are four small pegs, which are passing information about your progress.<br/>
The black peg informs you that the larger peg on the same spot on the board is in the right place.<br/>
The blue peg tells you that the larger peg in that colour is in diffrent place on the board.<br/>
You've got 10 turns to get your code right.<br/>
Good luck, Loser!</p>

Graphics by me.
